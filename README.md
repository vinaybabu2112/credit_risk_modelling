# üí≥ Credit Risk Modelling with Machine Learning

This project focuses on building a machine learning pipeline to predict whether a loan applicant is likely to default. It involves data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. This type of model can be used by banks, NBFCs, and fintech platforms to automate and enhance the credit risk assessment process.



## üìå Objective

To classify customers as **high-risk** or **low-risk** based on historical loan application data using machine learning techniques. The project helps financial institutions make informed decisions during the loan approval process.



## üßæ Dataset Overview

- **Source**: Publicly available dataset (e.g. Kaggle, Lending Club ‚Äì update if known)
- **Total Records**: ~10,000+
- **Target Variable**: `Loan_Status` or `Default`
- **Key Features**:
  - Applicant income
  - Employment status
  - Credit history
  - Loan amount
  - Marital status
  - Property area
  - Debt-to-income ratio
  - Number of dependents
  - Education level
