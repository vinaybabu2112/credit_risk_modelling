# Credit Risk Modelling with Machine Learning 💳

**Objective:** Build a model to predict borrower default risk (binary classification: default vs non-default) based on demographics, loan history, and financial indicators.

## 🧠 Modeling Approach

* EDA & preprocessing
* Handling class imbalance (SMOTE / undersampling)
* Feature selection & engineering
* Trained models: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
* Hyperparameter tuning via GridSearchCV
* Interpretation with SHAP/LIME

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics

* Accuracy: 0.XX
* AUC‑ROC: 0.XX
* Precision / Recall / F1-score
* KS-statistic or Gini Coefficient

## 🚩 Key Insights

* Top drivers: credit history, loan amount, income-to-debt ratio
* X model outperformed others after hyperparameter tuning
* Feature interactions improved discriminatory power
